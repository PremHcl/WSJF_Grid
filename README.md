WSJF_Grid
=========================

## Overview
SDK V2.0
Weighted Shortest Job First Grid This app displays a grid that shows the values
used to calculate the WSJF score, and then calculate the score. The values in 
the grid are editable, but the score is not as it is calculated based on the
values. The columns are sortable, so for example if you want to sort by Score, 
just click on the "Score" column.

The Details: The app has a PI Type selection field and a Release Timebox. Note 
that the Release Timebox is only used when the lowest level PI Type is selected,
e.g. "Feature". Project Scope is obeyed.
The WSJF score calculation is 
( Time Criticality + RR/OE Value + User/Business Value)/ Job Size
